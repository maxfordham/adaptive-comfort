To build, do the following: 

**note**: we assume you are in the same dir as this README.txt file. 

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml # create conda env
conda activate adaptive-comfort-docs # activate 

python _docs_build_local.py # build docs
# ^ note. normally we'd just run the sphinx command here to build docs...
#   but to make SPHINX_GITHUB_CHANGELOG extension work we have to modify 
#   the conf.py file after it is generated by jupyterbook
```

Notes.
- when authoring notebooks that will be executed, the notebook must be
  authored from directly within the environment - __not__ using nb_conda_kernels
- Issue on Public repo still needing github token to access releases:
