Note:,A TM 52 2013 analysis provides an assessment of comfort compliance based on bulk air modelling
,i.e. each space is considered idealised and the air in the space perfectly mixed. The assessment does
,"not assess placement of space features e.g. windows & openings, airflow patterns or discomfort issues."
,The user should assess these design aspects outside of the TM52 analysis.
